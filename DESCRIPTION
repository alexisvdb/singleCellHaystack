Description: Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is a key step in single-cell 
    transcriptomics data analysis. 'singleCellHaystack' predicts DEGs without relying on 
    clustering of cells into arbitrary clusters. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is 
    often processed to fewer dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and 
    represented in 2-dimensional plots (e.g. t-SNE or UMAP plots). 'singleCellHaystack' 
    uses Kullback-Leibler divergence to find genes that are expressed in subsets of cells 
    that are non-randomly positioned in a these multi-dimensional spaces or 2D representations. 
    For the theoretical background of 'singleCellHaystack' we refer to 
    Vandenbon and Diez (Nature Communications, 2020) <doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17900-3>.
