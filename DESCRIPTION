Description: Haystack finds genes that have a biased expression level in a two-dimensional representation of 
    higher-dimensional transcriptome data, such as single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq). scRNA-seq data is often 
    represented in 2D plots, such as plots of two principal components, or in t-SNE plots. Many genes are not 
    expressed in all cells in these plots, but rather only in a subset of cells, which might be located in 1 or more
    clusters in the 2D plot. Haystack can be used to find such genes, that have a highly non-random pattern of expression.
