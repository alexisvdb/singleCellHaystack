Description: One key exploratory analysis step in single-cell genomics data analysis
    is the prediction of features with different activity levels. For example, we want 
    to predict differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in single-cell RNA-seq data, 
    spatial DEGs in spatial transcriptomics data, or differentially accessible 
    regions (DARs) in single-cell ATAC-seq data. 'singleCellHaystack' predicts differentially
    active features in single cell omics datasets without relying on the clustering
    of cells into arbitrary clusters. 'singleCellHaystack' uses Kullback-Leibler 
    divergence to find features (e.g., genes, genomic regions, etc) that are active
    in subsets of cells that are non-randomly positioned inside an input space (such as 
    1D trajectories, 2D tissue sections, multi-dimensional embeddings, etc). For 
    the theoretical background of 'singleCellHaystack' we refer to our original paper
    Vandenbon and Diez (Nature Communications, 2020) <doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17900-3>
    and our update Vandenbon and Diez (Scientific Reports, 2023) <doi:10.1038/s41598-023-38965-2>.
