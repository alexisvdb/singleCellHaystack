Description: `singleCellHaystack` is a package for finding surprising needles
    (=genes) in haystacks (=single cell transcriptome data). Single-cell RNA-seq
    (scRNA-seq) data is often converted to fewer dimensions using Principal 
    Component Analysis (PCA) and represented in 2-dimentional plots (e.g. t-SNE 
    or UMAP plots). `singleCellHaystack` can be used for finding genes that are 
    expressed in subsets of cells that are non-randomly distributed in these 
    multi-dimensional spaces or 2D representations.
